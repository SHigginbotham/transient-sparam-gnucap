# transient-sparam-gnucap
Device plugin for Gnucap which uses vector fitting and recursive convolution to allow pure transient simulations with S-parameter networks which are described by tabulated frequency domain data.

## Description
Initially created by Se√°n Higginbotham as an M.A.I project at Trinity College Dublin in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, 2023-24. Supervisor: Dr. Justin King.

## File Descriptions

## Dependancies
Gnucap documentation and installation instructions found here: <https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnucap/>.
This project used 'master 2021.01.07', though later versions should work just fine.

LAPACK version 3.12.0 was used for linear algebra computations, see <https://netlib.org/lapack/> for LAPACK homepage. The  compressed ```.tar.gz``` file for LAPACK is given in the ```/rc``` directory. It will need to be extracted and built from source.

## Compilation
Instructions for building Gnucap are included in the downloaded source from its repository; from the top directory simply type
```
./configure
make install
```
Building LAPACK is more involved, but instructions are also given in the downloaded source. It will need to be compiled into ```.so``` dynamic library files for the compilation of ```rc_model.cc``` to work.

Compiling ```rc_model.cc``` ...
