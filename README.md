# transient-sparam-gnucap
Device plugin for Gnucap which uses vector fitting and recursive convolution to allow pure transient simulations with S-parameter networks which are described by tabulated frequency domain data.

## Description
Initially created by Se√°n Higginbotham as an M.A.I project at Trinity College Dublin in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, 2023-24. Supervisor: Dr. Justin King.

## File Descriptions

## Dependancies
Gnucap documentation and installation instructions found here: <https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnucap/>.
This project used 'master 2021.01.07', though later versions should work just fine.

LAPACK version 3.12.0 was used for linear algebra computations, see <https://netlib.org/lapack/> for LAPACK homepage. The  compressed ```.tar.gz``` file for LAPACK is given in the ```/rc``` directory. It will need to be extracted and built from source.

## Compilation
Instructions for building Gnucap are included in the downloaded source from its repository; from the top directory simply type
```
./configure
make install
```
Building LAPACK is more involved, but instructions are also given in the downloaded source. It will need to be compiled into ```.so``` dynamic library files for the compilation of ```rc_model.cc``` to work.
For simplicity, a ```make.inc``` file is provided in this repository, which should contain the required changes to compile LAPACK properly. Place this file into the ```.../lapack-3.12.0/``` top directory, and then run the following commands from this same directory.
```
make
cd LAPACKE
make
cd ../CBLAS
make
```
After all the compiling is done, there should be five dynamic library files in the top directory: ```libcblas.so```, ```liblapack.so```, ```libtmglib.so```, ```liblapacke.so```, and ```librefblas.so```.

To compile the Gnucap plugin, run the following in the directory where  ```vf.h``` and  ```rc_model.cc``` are located. It's assumed that LAPACK is installed in  ```~/code/```. Change the linking and include paths as necessary; both the Gnucap and LAPACK headers and  ```.so``` library files are needed.
```
g++ -shared -fPIC rc_model.cc ~/code/lapack-3.12.0/liblapack.so ~/code/lapack-3.12.0/libtmglib.so ~/code/lapack-3.12.0/liblapacke.so ~/code/lapack-3.12.0/librefblas.so ~/code/lapack-3.12.0/libcblas.so -o rc.so -I~/code/lapack-3.12.0/LAPACKE/include -I~/code/lapack-3.12.0/CBLAS/include -I/usr/local/include/gnucap -L~/code/lapack-3.12.0 -L/usr/local/lib/ -l lapack -l lapacke -l gfortran -lcblas -l tmglib -l refblas
```
The final result is a file, ```rc.so```, which is linked into Gnucap by typing ```load rc.so``` inside a Gnucap runtime. Note that ```rc.so``` should ideally be placed somewhere that is searched by the ```LD_LIBRARY_PATH``` environment variable.
